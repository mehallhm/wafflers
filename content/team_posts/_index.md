## User Personas

### Persona #1: EcoUnity Europe  

Description: NGO Description: EcoUnity Europe is an NGO that primarily focuses on promoting sustainable development within Europe. Their mission involves trying to gain more active participation from communities in their educational programs, working with businesses to implement sustainable practices, and developing strategies to help communities adapt to the changing climate as well as trying to mitigate any further climate change. 


User Story #1:As a non profit organization, it is hard to gain funding in order to have adequate resources to educate the public about potential efforts to mitigate climate change. In order to help EcoUnity Europe’s initiatives, it is essential to try to attract ideal donors who are more willing to support EcoUnity Europe. It would be useful to be able to connect with users based on statistics to gain the interest of people that are already interested in climate change, reducing efforts in gaining more people within the organization. 


User Story #2:As an NGO dedicated to helping communities that are the most vulnerable to climate change within the EU, it is essential to make sure that the EcoUnity Europe’s efforts are going to those that need it the most. Having a feature that allows EcoUnity to view community statistics that are vulnerable to climate change NGOs can shift their objectives towards those communities. 

User Story #3:  As an NGO in order to increase the effectiveness of educational content by potentially personalizing the content towards certain users. In order to produce more heavily personalized educational content EcoUnity Europe would need a feature to view users survey results in order to decide what content would be the most effective in drawing customers to their objectives.

### Persona # 3: John Davis

Description: John Davis is the secretary of emissions and energy of Belgium. He works closely with fellow members of Belgium’s government as well as EU representatives to optimize energy usage and reduce harmful emissions. He also helps to write policies and regulations based on energy/emissions.

User Story #1: As the secretary of energy and emissions, I want to be able to select or see all policies related to emissions and analyze their effect on the EU or Belgium as a whole so that I can see what legislative actions are effective. It would be helpful to see a full breakdown of the types of emissions and quantities or even the types of energy production (wind, solar, coal, etc.).

User Story #2: As the secretary of energy and emissions, I want to have an intuitive compare tool to see the emissions and energy breakdowns of Belgium compared to other member states. I would also like to have a predictive model for comparison to see if our emissions are on the right track compared to another country. This would give insight as to whether policy is even necessary or no action is needed.

User Story #3: As the secretary of energy and emissions, I would like to be able to have a predictive tool in the application to calculate the effect of potential policy. For example, I could input that we need our CO2 emissions to be down 20% and the calculator could output what every citizen of Belgium would need to decrease their admissions by to achieve this goal. It would be extra helpful if it also outputted ways to reduce emissions by this amount for each user. This would serve to guide future emission and energy regulations.

## Questions:

- Is there a correlation between the threat of climate change and a shift in energy transactions (selling/buying) made on an international level?
  - The answer to this question will define which countries are more dependent on import of energy versus a reliance on a domestic production, especially as climate change may impact a countries ability to produce energy.
- Is there a relationship between increasing climate change and sources of energy (a shift from combustible to renewable, or vice versa)?
  - This question will indicate two things: whether or not climate change has an impact on the sources of energy, or if policy enacted to fight climate change is having a tangible effect on a country's energy usage.
- Which countries in the EU produce the most harmful emissions or are predicted to in the near future?
 - This question is interesting and can be used by the EU to determine which countries need to reduce their emissions the most. The prediction can indicate whether preventative measures should be taken to ensure emissions don't rise drastically.
