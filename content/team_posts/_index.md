## Questions:

- Is there a correlation between the threat of climate change and a shift in energy transactions (selling/buying) made on an international level?
  - The answer to this question will define which countries are more dependent on import of energy versus a reliance on a domestic production, especially as climate change may impact a countries ability to produce energy.
- Is there a relationship between increasing climate change and sources of energy (a shift from combustible to renewable, or vice versa)?
  - This question will indicate two things: whether or not climate change has an impact on the sources of energy, or if policy enacted to fight climate change is having a tangible effect on a country's energy usage.
