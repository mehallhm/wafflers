# Phase 1 Dialogue Reflection

The main reason that I wanted to join this dialogue was because I truly wanted to experience how having an interdisciplinary background can truly bring forward intelligent innovation to solve the world’s most complex problems. My experience in this dialogue has not fallen short of that expectation and has even succeeded in what I thought that I would learn. Through this dialogue I was able to attend numerous conversations about the intersections between computer science and business in the fields of political science. 

One of the most inspirational conversations that I had was during our visit to the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO) where we discussed NATO’s political agenda and transatlantic relations. Through this conversation I was able to understand the objectives of NATO and how those objectives have shifted due to emerging landscapes. I was able to grasp the importance of NATO mitigating their macroenvironments in order to make sure that security is at its peak. It was interesting to learn about how the shift in disruptive technologies has truly shifted how NATO has to respond to certain threats and problems.Even though I enjoy discussing the positive effects of technology, this conversation made me realize that it is equally important to talk about the downsides as well.   More specifically the threat of misinformation has become a serious problem that divides previously united communities resulting in a threat in security. Making me reflect on the responsibility that I have towards society as an aspiring software engineer. As someone who wants to make sure that what I develop is truly being used for the benefit of society it has made me realize that I would truly like to learn more about how technologies can be used to combat the issues of misinformation spread. 

Regarding the same topic of misinformation we were able to expand on the more technological terms in order to combat misinformation during our visit to the European Union External Action. Learning about the FIMI(Foreign Information Manipulation & Interference) framework and how the EEAS has confronted this problem was interesting to learn about since I wasn't aware of the severity of misinformation as a threat to national security, but it was interesting to learn that FIMI is not a complete technological problem but also a socio-cognitive problem as well truly bridging the gap between humanity and technology when it comes to solving these problems and finding the intent of the person behind it. It was emphasized that finding the best methods to be used within the Attack Arsenal, the set of tools they use to attack misinformation through cybersecurity, requires accurate linking to the type of attack and the specific intent.

In summary this dialogue has truly provided me with an opportunity to not only expand my technological knowledge but learn more about how my technological skills can be applied to problems of this world. Learning more about Belgian culture and Europe as a whole has helped me learn about the differences and relations between different countries and expand my eyes into how these nations communicate with each other and use technologies to expedite processes that may have taken more. This dialogue experience has given me hope and has ignited my passion for finding ways that technology can be used to address problems that may have been hard to solve previously.
