### Project Reflection

Individually I contributed the Exploratory Data Analysis as well as the Machine Learning prototype. Being the only DS3000 kid in our group, I had a lot of work that was not necessarily hard, but rather time consuming. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how the algorithm would work and what data would be used. This surfaced as lots of diagrams and chats with the team to continue to hone down the idea into something tangible and buildable. We went through several iterations on how to take our Phase I ideas and impliment them, with the Professors' feedback. I felt like I was always on Eurostat browsing for data that either was useful, or a stepping stone to what I needed for the model / app.

After getting what I wanted / needed to build down, the actually programming / data science was quite straightforward but time consuming. Finding edge cases when building the Eurostat parser (only to find out there was a library ðŸ™ƒ), parsing and cleaning the data, and finally pulling it into the model just took a while to manipulate the dataframe as well as write cleanish code that could be expanded to more data with minimal effort.

### Belgium Reflection

In terms of the best things that have happened since the last Phase reflection, the choclate and pastry extravagansa takes the cake(pun intended). The chaos of getting your hands messy in chocolate and cream to create delicious treats that we consumed afterwards was amazing. The atmosphere of everyone in a cramped space, covered in food, was hilarious amounts of fun. On top of that, the treats were amazing and to share them with everyone else really cemented the culture of the group where everyone is confortable being themselves.
