# Phase 3 Dialogue Reflection

As this dialogue gets closer to the end, I realized that even though things have become more challenging, I still have a lot of growth to achieve within the remainder of my computer science degree at Northeastern. Despite the difficulties, I have grown significantly. During this part of the project, I admit that creating routes that connected with the APIs was quite challenging for me. However, by struggling through it, I was able to grow and understand routes much better than before. Reflecting on this experience, I realize that sometimes struggling through challenges is important in order for me to truly learn.  Even though it can be frustrating at times, I will look back on this experience and realize that I can overcome challenging tasks.

During this part of the project, my main contributions were creating some of the routes for the NGO persona and assisting with the logo and other design aspects of the project. This experience has made me realize that I may take longer than others to fully grasp parts of the project, and that it is sometimes best to take time for myself to digest and understand different elements fully. Since I want to make the most out of this experience and truly understand my project in depth.

In the broader context of this dialogue, this week we had numerous discussions about the changing technological landscapes and the intersections between technology and policy within Europe. It was particularly interesting to hear from Digital Europe and learn about the statistics regarding Europeâ€™s technological landscape. This helped me realize the numerous differences between the US and  Europe. Becoming aware of these differences has expanded my knowledge, deepened my understanding, and made me realize the downsides of extensive policy versus having less policy. This has truly given me something to think about and has shown me the immense importance of the intersections between policy and technology as technology continues to emerge.
