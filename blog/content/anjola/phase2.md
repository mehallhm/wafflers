# Phase 2 Dialogue Reflection

During this part of our project, we went through several changes as we further implemented our ideas. The main change we made was deciding not to implement the government persona and instead choosing to use an enterprise persona as an alternative. I was able to further develop this persona and decide to connect NGOs with businesses. This allows businesses to connect with NGOs that are already experienced with the initiatives they are trying to improve on, so they can receive advice to further those initiatives. I also identified the benefit for NGOs in matching with businesses: they can receive information on which businesses are more likely to donate to their causes since businesses typically donate more than an average member of the NGO.

Additionally, I created the wireframe for our app. Even though I was not familiar with wireframes before, it was interesting to expand into new avenues and learn more about the process of creating a user interface and deciding how different users will view the app. This helped the idea become more concrete and helped me visualize how the interface would look.

Lastly, along with the rest of my teammates, we finalized the SQL DDL and decided how we would relate tables to have an efficient database for our data to correctly implement the features we wanted. Even though this part of the project has been challenging, it has been useful in teaching me how to effectively navigate through problems with the help of communication with my teammates. It has also helped me better understand how databases contribute to app development.
