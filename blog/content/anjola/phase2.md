# Phase 2 Dialogue Reflection

During this part of our project, we went through several changes as we further implemented our ideas. The main change we made was deciding not to implement the government persona and instead choosing to use an enterprise persona as an alternative. I was able to further develop this persona and decide to connect NGOs with businesses. This allows businesses to connect with NGOs that are already experienced with the initiatives they are trying to improve on, so they can receive advice to further those initiatives. I also identified the benefit for NGOs in matching with businesses: they can receive information on which businesses are more likely to donate to their causes since businesses typically donate more than an average member of the NGO.

Additionally, I created the wireframe for our app. Even though I was not familiar with wireframes before, it was interesting to expand into new avenues and learn more about the process of creating a user interface and deciding how different users will view the app. This helped the idea become more concrete and helped me visualize how the interface would look.

Lastly, along with the rest of my teammates, we finalized the SQL DDL and decided how we would relate tables to have an efficient database for our data to correctly implement the features we wanted. Even though this part of the project has been challenging, it has been useful in teaching me how to effectively navigate through problems with the help of communication with my teammates. It has also helped me better understand how databases contribute to app development.

Regarding, the general trip even though this week as quite busy in terms of work load it was an amazing experience to be able to take a break and attend a pastry making class. As important as it is to learn all of the content that this dialogue has given me I think it is as important to learn about Belgian culture adn this was an amazing. experinece to learn more about Belgian cuisine through learning about basic pastries. I also truly enjoyed listening to the speakers at Microsoft and learning how Microsoft is mitigating the changing laws and making sure that their technologies are correctly argued for. This talk truly made me realize how important it is to have professionals in technology be a part of the law decision process for technological law and it also helped me realize that sometimes working with technology does not have to be strictly technological but can also be combined with many different fields.
