These are images of each of the user personas. The homescreen for each user persona allows them to implement the features mentioned in their respective user persona stories. The main features for users and enterprises include taking surveys to gather further information, while the NGO persona does not take a survey. Instead, NGOs select the tags they want to be associated with and are matched with users based on these tags.

![NGO Survey](./ngosurvey.jpg) | [NGO Match](./ngomatch.jpg)
In the NGO user persona, NGOs decide which tags they want to be associated with. Based on these tags, they receive a list, similar to the example above, allowing them to see which users and enterprises they have been matched with.

User Survey 
![User Survey](./usersurvey.jpg) 
In the general user persona, users take a survey, and based on this survey data, the app interacts with a machine learning model to estimate future carbon emissions and provide data on their current carbon emissions.

Enterprise Survey 
![Enterprise Survey](./enterprisehome.jpg) 
Enterprises, similar to general users, also take a survey. This survey allows them to match with general users and NGOs.
