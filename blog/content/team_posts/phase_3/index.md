## Database ER Diagrams

| User Homescreen                        | Enterprise Homescreen                          | NGO homescreen Diagram               |

These are images of each of the user personas. The homescreen for each user persona allows them to implement the features mentioned in their respective user persona stories. The main features for users and enterprises include taking surveys to gather further information, while the NGO persona does not take a survey. Instead, NGOs select the tags they want to be associated with and are matched with users based on these tags.

| NGO Survey  
![NGO Survey](./ngosurvey.jpg)
![NGO Tags](./ngotags.jpg)
In the NGO user persona, NGOs decide which tags they want to be associated with.  
NGO users can add or delete tags if they so desire and they can also update their recorded information.

| Enterprise NGO Match
![NGO Match](./ngomatch.jpg)
Enterprises have a feature where they can match with NGOs with the same tags as displayed in this screenshot.
There is also a comparison to your average company emission within the same country to give enterprises more insight on their emissions.

| User Survey
![User Survey](./usersurvey.jpg)
![User Survey](./usersurveyres.jpg)
In the general user persona, users take a survey, and based on this survey data, the app interacts with a machine learning model to estimate future carbon emissions and provide data on their current carbon emissions.

![User History](./userhistory.jpg)
Users can also see their survey history and previous emission data.
