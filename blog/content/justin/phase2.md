# Phase 2 Dialogue Reflection

During phase II, I contributed to many areas of the project. As a group, we decided to scrap the government entity persona and I helped to make the business persona with the new features and updated the ER diagram. I created the ER diagram for the government entity persona and assisted in the creation and merging of the other two. Next, I made the tables for the intermediate ER diagram so that we could translate it into actual code. With the CS members of our group, I wrote the code for the SQL DDL to create tables in SQL In terms of visual improvements to the blog, I added a group author profile which appears on the landing page with a waffle icon. I also enabled the searching by tags feature and helped to create the Google Slides wireframe. For ease of use, I added a GitHub icon to the navbar and the group author profile which links to our GitHub repository.
